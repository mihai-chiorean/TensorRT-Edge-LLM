# Experimental Python API and Server

The experimental Python frontend accepts a supported checkpoint, builds all of
its runtime components directly, and exposes offline generation plus OpenAI and
Anthropic HTTP APIs. ONNX is not used by this path.

> **Status:** Experimental. Only the API contracts and launch options described
> here are supported.

## Install

For a supported target, follow [published-wheel installation](../getting_started/installation.md#published-python-wheel)
and select `tensorrt-edgellm[server]==0.11.0`. The wheel includes the runtime
bindings, builder, and plugin; no checkout, `native-build` extra, or CMake build
is needed. Install the TensorRT Python bindings supported by the target
platform before launching the server. Run the examples in that environment
outside a source checkout.

Alternatively, complete the [source build and server setup](../getting_started/installation.md#install-and-launch-the-python-server).
Do not reinstall the source package over a published wheel.

For gated checkpoints, accept the provider's terms and run `hf auth login`.
The server extra supplies `huggingface-hub` for downloads. Model-provided Jinja
templates run natively through Pantor Inja; serving does not require Jinja2 or
the PyTorch/ONNX exporter.

## Python API

`model` is a Hugging Face model ID or a local checkpoint directory. On a cache
miss, one builder invocation compiles every component owned by the model
family. Supported weights stay outside the engines and are loaded once from
the resolved checkpoint during runtime initialization.

```python
from experimental.server import LLM, SamplingParams

llm = LLM(
    model="Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B",
    cache_dir="/data/edgellm-cache",
    max_input_len=4096,
    max_kv_cache_capacity=8192,
)
result = llm.chat(
    [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain paged KV caches."}],
    SamplingParams(max_tokens=128, temperature=0),
)
print(result.text)
```

Pass `enable_in_flight_batching=True` together with `max_batch_size` to let
concurrent `chat()`, `generate()`, and `generate_stream()` calls from several
threads share the running batch instead of taking turns; see
[In-Flight Batching](../features/in-flight-batching.md).

Streaming uses the same runtime:

```python
for delta in llm.generate_stream(
    [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a CUDA optimization checklist."}],
    SamplingParams(max_tokens=128),
):
    print(delta.text, end="", flush=True)
```

## Start the Server

Pass the model checkpoint:

```bash
tensorrt-edgellm-serve Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B \
  --cache-dir /data/edgellm-cache \
  --max-input-len 4096 \
  --max-kv-cache-capacity 8192 \
  --port 8000
```

Add `--enable-in-flight-batching --max-batch-size 4` to serve up to four
requests at once; see [Runtime Concurrency](#runtime-concurrency).

The cache contains downloaded checkpoints and complete, profile-specific
runtime bundles. A launch reuses a bundle only when the base checkpoint,
optional draft checkpoint, and build profile all match. A cache miss runs
`tensorrt-edgellm-build --components all` internally and publishes the
completed bundle atomically. The builder's default policy externalizes the
weight kinds supported by each component. ONNX paths are rejected so the
server cannot lose the checkpoint-to-runtime association.

A directory of engines that were built outside the cache is served as-is: a
builder bundle (`llm.engine` at the root), or the tree written by `llm_build`
and `visual_build` (`llm/llm.engine` next to `visual/visual.engine`). Such a
bundle carries its own weights, tokenizer, and chat template, so no checkpoint
is resolved and nothing is built:

```bash
tensorrt-edgellm-serve /opt/models/gemma-4-e4b-engines \
  --max-input-len 8192 \
  --max-kv-cache-capacity 16384 \
  --enable-context-reuse
```

Compiled bundles use a 50 GiB least-recently-used cache by default. Set
`--engine-cache-max-size-gb` to another positive limit. Use
`--clear-engine-cache` to remove compiled bundles before launch while retaining
downloaded checkpoints. Moving or copying an unchanged checkpoint does not
invalidate its cached bundle. Python callers can perform cache maintenance with
`experimental.server.clear_engine_cache()` and `prune_engine_cache()`.

## Speculative Decoding

`--speculative-config` accepts `method`, `model`, and
`num_speculative_tokens`. The base, draft, and auxiliary model components are
built and cached as one paired runtime. When omitted, the server reads the
proposal length from the draft checkpoint. For EAGLE3 and MTP,
`num_speculative_tokens` is the number of sequential draft steps. For DFlash
and JetSpec it is the proposal block size; for dSpark it is the number of
proposal tokens, with one additional base-verification token.

EAGLE3 example:

```bash
tensorrt-edgellm-serve Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B \
  --cache-dir /data/edgellm-cache \
  --speculative-config \
  '{"method":"eagle3","model":"AngelSlim/Qwen3-1.7B_eagle3","num_speculative_tokens":3}'
```

DFlash example:

```bash
tensorrt-edgellm-serve Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B \
  --cache-dir /data/edgellm-cache \
  --speculative-config \
  '{"method":"dflash","model":"z-lab/Qwen3.5-4B-DFlash","num_speculative_tokens":3}'
```

Muse-Glimmer DFlash and DFlash2 examples:

```bash
tensorrt-edgellm-serve meta-models/Muse-Glimmer-30B \
  --cache-dir /data/edgellm-cache \
  --speculative-config \
  '{"method":"dflash","model":"meta-models/Muse-Glimmer-30B-assistant"}'

tensorrt-edgellm-serve meta-models/Muse-Glimmer-30B \
  --cache-dir /data/edgellm-cache \
  --speculative-config \
  '{"method":"dflash","model":"incoai/Muse-Glimmer-30B-DFlash2"}'

tensorrt-edgellm-serve RadixArk/Muse-Glimmer-NVFP4 \
  --cache-dir /data/edgellm-cache \
  --speculative-config \
  '{"method":"dflash","model":"incoai/Muse-Glimmer-30B-DFlash2"}'
```

JetSpec example:

```bash
tensorrt-edgellm-serve Qwen/Qwen3-8B \
  --cache-dir /data/edgellm-cache \
  --speculative-config \
  '{"method":"jetspec","model":"JetSpec/jetspec-qwen3-8b","num_speculative_tokens":16}'
```

dSpark example:

```bash
tensorrt-edgellm-serve Qwen/Qwen3-4B \
  --cache-dir /data/edgellm-cache \
  --speculative-config \
  '{"method":"dspark","model":"deepseek-ai/dspark_qwen3_4b_block7","num_speculative_tokens":7}'
```

For a checkpoint containing native MTP layers, select `mtp` without `model`.
Gemma MTP instead supplies its separate assistant checkpoint as `model`. The
server defaults MTP, DFlash, JetSpec, and dSpark to their linear contracts.
Where the method supports branching, setting `--draft-top-k` above 1 selects
its tree contract and causes the direct builder to compile matching tree-base
inputs automatically. `--max-verify-tree-size` and
`--max-draft-tree-size` set engine profile capacities, while
`--verify-tree-size` optionally selects a smaller active verification topology.
For linear MTP (`--draft-top-k 1`), omit `--verify-tree-size`; the server
derives the active size as `--draft-step + 1`, independently of the larger
build profile. The
`disable_spec_decode` request field can disable drafting for one request,
except with a Gemma MTP verification engine; use a standalone target bundle
for target-only Gemma inference.
See [Logit Bias](../format/input-format.md#logit-bias) for speculative-decoding
behavior and validation limits.

## KV Cache Reuse

Context reuse is disabled by default. Enable it when constructing the server:

```bash
tensorrt-edgellm-serve Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B \
  --cache-dir /data/edgellm-cache \
  --enable-context-reuse \
  --context-cache-max-records 1024
```

The Python API accepts the same deployment configuration and exposes native
reuse metrics:

```python
from experimental.server import ContextCacheConfig, LLM, SamplingParams

llm = LLM(
    model="Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B",
    context_cache_config=ContextCacheConfig(enabled=True, max_records=1024),
)
llm.generate("shared prefix", SamplingParams(max_tokens=32))
llm.generate("shared prefix with another suffix", SamplingParams(max_tokens=32))
print(llm.get_context_cache_metrics().reused_tokens)
```

`SamplingParams(reuse_context=False)` bypasses lookup and publication for a
request. `cache_generated_tokens=False` publishes only the prefill endpoint.
The OpenAI chat request exposes the same controls as strict boolean
`reuse_context` and `cache_generated_tokens` fields.

See the authoritative [KV Cache Reuse support matrix](../features/kv-cache-reuse.md#support-matrix)
for supported model and speculative-decoding contracts. Configure the server's
recurrent snapshot pools with
`--context-cache-recurrent-snapshot-pool-bytes` and
`--context-cache-partial-kv-snapshot-pool-bytes`.

With a chat template that folds a thinking marker into the generation prompt
(Qwen3 under `enable_thinking=false`, for example), the server publishes the
checkpoint before that marker and replays the few unstable tail tokens, so the
record stays valid as a prefix of the next turn.

For encoder-cache behavior and server configuration limits, see
[Encoder Embedding Cache](../features/kv-cache-reuse.md#configuring-the-encoder-embedding-cache).

For tenant isolation, follow the [cache-domain requirements](../features/kv-cache-reuse.md#cache-domain).

## OpenAI Chat

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],
    "max_tokens":128
  }'
```

Set `stream=true` for SSE chunks ending in `data: [DONE]`. Set
`stream_options.include_usage=true` for a final usage chunk. Usage is taken
from the native generation result; normal inference does not run a second
tokenization pass.

The request contract includes sampling, stop strings, log probabilities,
`logit_bias`, tools, `parallel_tool_calls`, thinking, structured output, and
per-request speculative disablement. `seed` accepts an unsigned 64-bit request
seed, and `top_k=-1` disables top-k filtering. `min_p` and text
`repetition_penalty` are accepted for client compatibility, but the runtime
currently supports only their defaults (`0.0` and `1.0`); non-default values
are normalized to those defaults with a server warning. Nonzero
`frequency_penalty` and `presence_penalty` remain unsupported and are rejected.
Only `n=1` is supported.
Provider chat templating and the assistant generation prompt are enabled by
default. Set `apply_chat_template=false` only for an already formatted prompt,
or `add_generation_prompt=false` when continuing an existing assistant turn.

### Structured Output

`response_format` constrains the reply to a JSON object or a JSON Schema:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Give me a person record."}],
    "response_format":{
      "type":"json_schema",
      "json_schema":{"name":"person","schema":{
        "type":"object",
        "properties":{"name":{"type":"string"},"age":{"type":"integer"}},
        "required":["name","age"]}}}
  }'
```

`response_format` covers `text`, `json_object`, and `json_schema` — the whole of
the OpenAI specification. For `regex`, `ebnf`, `structural_tag`, and `choice`,
use the low-level `guided_decoding` field, which takes the same shape as in a
request file:

```bash
  -d '{
    "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Answer yes or no."}],
    "guided_decoding":{"choice":["yes","no"]}
  }'
```

Setting both surfaces on one request is rejected rather than one silently
winning. Streaming works normally, and the assembled output satisfies the guide.
A schema keyword that the backend accepts but cannot enforce is rejected with a
400 naming the keyword. See [Guided Decoding](../features/guided-decoding.md).

### Tool Calls and Thinking

Launch automatic tool choice explicitly:

```bash
tensorrt-edgellm-serve Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B \
  --cache-dir /data/edgellm-cache \
  --enable-auto-tool-choice \
  --tool-call-parser qwen3_xml \
  --reasoning-parser qwen3
```

Requests use OpenAI `tools`, `tool_choice`, assistant `tool_calls`, and matching
`tool` messages. Parsed thinking is returned as `reasoning_content` only when
the request sets `enable_thinking=true` or
`chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=true`.
Streaming responses emit indexed tool-call deltas as soon as each generated
call is complete and end with `finish_reason="tool_calls"`.

Qwen3.8's provider template accepts `reasoning_effort` values `xhigh` (the
provider default), `medium`, and `low` when thinking is enabled. Edge-LLM
passes the value through unchanged, so an unsupported value fails template
rendering instead of being remapped. Because Edge-LLM defaults to non-thinking
requests, set `enable_thinking=true` together with the desired effort.

### Image, Video, and Audio Input

Serving a multimodal checkpoint builds and attaches its model-specific visual
and audio components automatically:

```bash
tensorrt-edgellm-serve Qwen/Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct \
  --cache-dir /data/edgellm-cache \
  --allowed-local-media-path /data/media
```

Muse-Glimmer image and video chat use its FP16 multimodal checkpoint; the
NVFP4 checkpoint is text-only:

```bash
tensorrt-edgellm-serve meta-models/Muse-Glimmer-30B \
  --cache-dir /data/edgellm-cache \
  --max-image-tokens 4096 \
  --max-image-tokens-per-image 4096 \
  --allowed-local-media-path /data/media
```

Use an `image_url` block for an image or a `video_url` block for a video.
Muse-Glimmer samples video at 2 FPS, up to 96 frames; `fps` and `nframes` on
the video content block override those defaults.

OpenAI content blocks accept `image_url`, `video_url`, `input_audio`, and
`audio_url` forms described in [Input Format](../format/input-format.md). Data
URLs and files under `--allowed-local-media-path` are supported. Remote HTTP
and HTTPS sources are downloaded with per-modality size limits and a bounded
timeout. Local paths remain disabled unless they are under the configured
allowed path.

Nemotron Omni video uses its checkpoint's video patch embedder and dynamic
aspect-preserving frame grids:

```bash
tensorrt-edgellm-serve \
  nvidia/Nemotron-3-Nano-Omni-30B-A3B-Reasoning-NVFP4 \
  --cache-dir /data/edgellm-cache \
  --allowed-local-media-path /data/media
```

Each Nemotron Omni request accepts one video and no additional images. Use
either `fps` or `nframes`; the server samples the clip, validates the visual
engine profile before decoding, and rejects frame lists that exceed its raw
pre-pruning tubelet capacity.

ASR-capable autoregressive models expose transcription:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -F file=@sample.wav \
  -F model=qwen3-asr \
  -F response_format=json
```

Uploads are limited to 25 MiB. The response format can be `json` or `text`.
Nemotron-3.5-ASR is a non-autoregressive RNN-T model with a separate
experimental server; see [Nemotron-3.5-ASR](../../developer_guide/models/nemotron3_5_asr.md).

### Omni Audio Output

When a model owns Talker, CodePredictor, and Code2Wav components, chat can
return text and PCM audio:

```json
{
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello"}],
  "modalities": ["text", "audio"],
  "audio": {"voice": "Ryan", "format": "pcm16"}
}
```

The same runtime exposes `POST /v1/audio/speech` and `GET /v1/voices`. Speech
output is 24 kHz, mono, signed 16-bit little-endian PCM. Both chat audio and
speech requests accept `talker_temperature`, `talker_top_k`, `talker_top_p`,
`repetition_penalty`, `max_audio_length`, `codec_chunk_frames`, and
`talker_prefill_threshold` alongside `voice`.

A TTS-only checkpoint uses the same model/cache contract from Python:

```python
from experimental.server import TTS

tts = TTS(
    model="Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice",
    cache_dir="/data/edgellm-cache",
)
tts.serve(port=8000)
```

## Anthropic and Claude Code

`POST /v1/messages` and `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` share the loaded model
and admission controller with OpenAI chat. The adapter supports system prompts,
text, base64 image blocks, client tools, `tool_use`/`tool_result`, thinking
output, and Anthropic SSE framing. Server-executed tools are not run by
TensorRT Edge-LLM.

Launch with a stable served name, then point Claude Code at the server:

```bash
tensorrt-edgellm-serve Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B \
  --cache-dir /data/edgellm-cache \
  --served-model-name qwen35-local

ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 \
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=local \
ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL=qwen35-local \
ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL=qwen35-local \
ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL=qwen35-local \
claude
```

When `--api-key` is set, both OpenAI bearer authentication and Anthropic
`x-api-key` authentication are accepted.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health`, `/health/ready` | Runtime, queue, and capability state; under in-flight batching also the scheduler counters (`scheduling`) |
| `GET` | `/v1/models` | The loaded model |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI chat and SSE |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages and SSE |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages/count_tokens` | Explicit input token count |
| `POST` | `/v1/audio/transcriptions` | ASR upload |
| `POST` | `/v1/audio/speech` | Omni/TTS PCM stream |
| `GET` | `/v1/voices` | Available speakers |

The server does not expose Completions, Responses, embeddings, tokenization, or
a metrics HTTP endpoint. Context-cache metrics are available from the Python
API.

## Runtime Concurrency

By default the server admits one request at a time: the runtime has one mutable
generation state, and a bounded async queue configured by
`--max-queued-requests` and `--queue-timeout` holds the rest. Queue overflow and
timeout return HTTP 429 (Anthropic 529). Streaming disconnects cancel the native
channel immediately, wait for the native worker to exit, and then release the
runtime lease. Engines stay resident across HTTP connections; graceful server
shutdown drains active work and releases the runtime and its device resources.

`--enable-in-flight-batching` replaces the one-at-a-time path with the request
engine: up to `--max-batch-size` requests decode together, and a new request
joins the running batch at the next generation boundary instead of waiting for
it to finish. Admission is then a limit rather than a queue: at most
`--max-batch-size` plus `--max-queued-requests` requests are in flight, and a
request past that limit gets an immediate 429. A disconnect cancels the request
inside the engine, so an abandoned stream stops decoding and frees its seat.
`/health` reports `in_flight_batching: true`, `max_num_seqs` equal to the batch
size, and a `scheduling` block with the engine's counters (submitted, completed,
cancelled, admissions that joined mid-flight, and the reasons a queued request
had to wait).

Not every deployment can take the flag, and not every request can join a
running batch; see [In-Flight Batching](../features/in-flight-batching.md) for
the support matrix. Chunked prefill scheduling and tensor parallelism remain on
the one-at-a-time path.
